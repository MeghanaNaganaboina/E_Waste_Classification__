# E-Waste Classification Project
Image classification project for identifying electronic waste using EfficientNetV2B0 and deep learning.


This project classifies e-waste images using EfficientNetV2B0 and transfer learning. The model is trained on 10 categories like Battery, Mobile, Mouse, Keyboard, etc.
